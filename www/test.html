Once he knew where Bowers lived, police said, he returned with Childs.“They believed the house would contain items of value because Arnesha’s grandmother has a job and owned two vehicles, and planned to break into the property and steal any valuables,” police wrote in a report.Police said the men knew Bowers’ grandmother was working and Bowers was home alone. If the teen awoke, police said, Dixon planned to put her in a chokehold.The pair entered through a basement window, police said. Bowers awoke, police said, and Dixon dragged her into the basement while Childs ransacked the home, taking money from purses and a safe.According to police, Childs told detectives that Dixon and Bowers were in the basement for 30 minutes.Then Dixon came upstairs and said they needed to leave “because the house was on fire,” police said. Dixon told Childs the girl was dead, police said.She had been raped, strangled, her body had been set on fire, as had her bed, dresser and a basement utility room, police said. They said a check of her phone showed calls between her phone and a phone belonging to Dixon hours before she was killed.Police said Childs confessed to the killing and burglary and implicated Dixon. Police arrested Dixon hours later.“Killers,” Batts said. “Sixteen-year-old, innocent teenager. … Nothing is more important than tracking down and jailing cowards who take the life of an innocent child. Nothing.”Court records show Childs was released from a Baltimore County jail on a burglary charge five days before Bowers was killed. Childs was charged with attempted murder in 2011, but prosecutors dropped the charge.Dixon has a prior drug possession conviction, court records show.</div></div></div><br><div class="section" onclick="showFullStory(&quot;<div>Tuesday, June 16, 2015</div>&quot;)"><div class="title"><div>Kanye and Kim K celebrate their daughter-North West as she turns 2 in Disneyland</div></div><div class="story_image"><img class="image_items" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-f2tEgkm6hIU/VX-o3UJvdCI/AAAAAAAFkcY/ph07BvLYPm4/s400/1.jpg"></div><div class="story"><div class="story_content" <div="">2 year old North West's Disneyland birthday party had&nbsp;her Dad Kanye West, the&nbsp;whole Kardashian/Jenner clan and Kylie Jenner's rumoured beau Tyga and his son-King in attendance.

Honor's note told Sir Branson that when she was diagnosed with dyslexia she thought her life was ruined, but the letters made her feel much more confident. The businessman wrote back thanking Honor for writing, adding: "If anyone ever puts you down for having dyslexia, don’t believe them. Being dyslexic can actually be a big advantage, and it has certainly helped me."Your life definitely isn’t ruined – I look forward to hearing what great things to achieve in the years to come." He signs off with: "I look forward to hearing what great things you've achieved in life."  Writing on his Virgin.com blog, he adds: "If you do have dyslexia, remember that the likes of Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, Ted Turner and even Albert Einstein did too.

"Before her transition she was being bullied. After her transition she was being bullied."Family and friends said Karis voiced her concerns to the school's principal, but they went ignored.Despite that, Greinke said, "I don't blame MPS for my daughter's death. I believe the sad thing it that important things were missed.""The way it was handled is disappointing," said Madeline Dietrich, friend. "That it seemed to be more covered up than shared."In order to bring change, Dietrich is calling attention to the issue, writing an open letter to MPS superintendent Dr. Darienne Driver."I hope that Dr. Driver will acknowledge the incident, in terms of a case where there was bullying happening," said Dietrich via phone. "I hope she makes a public statement."Last Sunday on Greinke's birthday, family and friends gathered to celebrate Karis' life and remember the passion she had for helping others, despite no one helping her."It's not to blame MPS," Greinke said. "The goal is for this to never happen to anybody again. So that things are taken seriously for all human beings."We asked MPS about the claims Karis was being bullied and the alleged lack of action by the principal. A spokesperson sent us this, "Ms. Ross was a longtime member of the Milwaukee German Immersion School staff whose presence is still missed."Source:&nbsp; </div><div>It's not easy for Jill Greinke to be in the room decorated by her late 37-year-old daughter Karis Anne Ross.

Karis committed suicide in November 2014 and left a suicide note, saying the bullying had happened for 10 years, while teaching at German Immersion School.</div></div></div><br><div class="section" onclick="showFullStory(&quot;<div>Monday, June 15, 2015</div>&quot;)"><div class="title"><div>My open letter to Prof. Wole Soyinka on his open letter - Sen.

Rosbon was a friend of Rudo's ex husband and got into a relationship with her after her marriage ended. They dated briefly and then she decided to call off the relationship. Her decision to call off their relationship made Reverend Rosbon angry.After Rudo refused his pleading for them to get back together, he attacked her with acid.Narrating how he attacked her, Rudo saidRudo who is currently receiving medical attention at the Parirenyatwa Hospital in Harare, said she was shocked to find the Reverend waiting for her at the Bus StopReverend Munamba who is the pastor of Full Gospel of Christ based in Botswana will appear in court soon. </div><div>"He would always say he would kill me if I decided to dump him but I didn’t believe him until the day he pounced on me. I had on several occasions tried to end things to the extent of changing my phone numbers but somehow he would always phone me. On the day in question he attacked me, he had phoned the previous night saying that he wanted to see me. I told him that I would not be around since I wanted to attend a funeral in my rural home in Goromonzi. He asked me if I was really serious about ending the relationship and I insisted that it was over. He again started with the threats telling me that no one dumps him,”Rudo said</div><div>“So as we were walking towards my home, he then produced a container from his bag and tried forcing me to drink the liquid. Before I could even notice what was in the container he held my mouth and tried to force me to open it, he almost strangled me and because he missed my mouth part of the liquid got into my ear and the other side of the face. He then started pouring the rest of the liquid all over my body and I was in so much pain, I started screaming for help and immediately I was undressed I guess because of the effect of the acid. I am in pain but I want you to hear my story. I am sure when people heard me screaming, they thought it was because of the funeral I was supposed to attend. I fell and I don’t know what happened next because I should have passed out. I am sure he also ran away during that time" she said.</div></div></div><br><div class="section" onclick="showFullStory(&quot;<div>Monday, June 15, 2015</div>&quot;)"><div class="title"><div>New Music: TJan ft Reminisce - I Love You So</div></div><div class="story_image"><img class="image_items" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-8PZW_6OS7EA/VX75XfkYwwI/AAAAAAAFkNQ/Hv-oYMxYkn8/s400/unnamed.png"></div><div class="story"><div class="story_content" <div="">Facebook&nbsp;</div><div>Amidst a successful debut this 2015, Right Entertainment ace musical enigma TJan is set to thrill his ever growing teeming fans with yet another hot musical concoction which is a remix of his chart bursting song I Love You So featuring Reminisce.The talented Afro-Soul Tjan act who is gradually becoming a household name caused a major stir in the music industry when he officially released the original version of the song in January this year.Right Entertainment once again wants to wow the music world with the remix of I LOVE YOU SO featuring His Reminisce.Get ready…on your marks…set go…let’s do music RIGHT ‘cos we Love You So!</div></div></div><br><div class="section" onclick="showFullStory(&quot;<div>Monday, June 15, 2015</div>&quot;)"><div class="title"><div>Graphic pic: See what an aunt did to her 9yr old nephew for eating at a party</div></div><div class="story_image"><img class="image_items" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-JlX3dwhtJ-g/VX70ES1oVdI/AAAAAAAFkMc/80heTyzqWYY/s400/1.png"></div><div class="story"><div class="story_content" <div="">The woman pictured left named Ronke Olayinka has been arrested for inflicting terrible injuries on her 9 year old nephew named Abdullahi Taoreed (left). According to , the woman inflicted blade cuts on the boy for eating at a party on June 7th. The boy's parents are dead.On the day of the incident Abdullahi said he went to the house opposite theirs at Pipeline Street in Oke-Odo area of Lagos to serve food and also to eat since there was no food in their house.This got his aunt, who he calls mummy, angryNeighbors who saw him with the injury alerted the police at the Oko-Oba police station who immediately arrested the aunt. When interrogated, she said Abdullahi was a stubborn child who never listens to herAsked why she used a blade instead of a cane on the boy, Olayinka said:Abdullahi said it was not the first time his Aunt had physically assaulted him.</div><div>"Yes, it was my mummy who inflicted blade cuts on my hands because I went to a party opposite our house to eat. There was no food at home. I was hungry, so I assisted the people holding the party to carry chairs. I knew that if I assisted them, they would give me food. They gave me food. My sister went to report to my mummy. We went for evening prayer. After the prayer, my mummy called me and started cutting my hands with a blade. She went out to buy the blade. The cut was deep. She poured pepper into the wounds. She then gave me a hot pot of beans to carry to the kitchen with the bloodied hands. One of our neighbors, a woman, saw me and took the pot from me. She went and told everyone in the compound. People saw my hands and started crying. It’s not every time my mummy gives me food. She uses a piece of wood to beat me, but uses canes on her kids.”he told New Telegraph</div><div>“I’m a struggling widow. I have three kids. One is 15, the second is 12 and the third is 10. I’m a trader. I leave home in the morning and come back at night. Whenever I return, neighbours usually complain about Abdullahi; how he usually goes to different places to eat. Sometimes, he would go with his friends to a place called Agbele-Kale to swim. He’s just stubborn and doesn’t listen! He’s my brother’s son. I’ve been taking care of him since he was a baby. He behaves like someone without home training. He usually goes to parties to eat. He was behaving like someone who doesn’t have parents or like someone who has no home training. When I returned on Saturday, neighbours said I should warn him. On Sunday, he went out again. Food was ready, but he was nowhere to be seen. I was angry. I used the blade on his two hands. I never knew it would be that bad!”</div><div>"Anytime I want to beat him, he would run away, forcing me to chase him. But what happened that day was the work of the devil. Yes, I poured pepper on the wounds.
